# Secure-tower
## Introduction
Secure Tower is a strategy Tower Defence game developed in Unity. This game is developed using a medieval theme. The game is quite simple, the player has to defend his tower from the enemy goblins who try to attack the tower. The level of difficulty increases from level to level. The detaild explanation of the game is provided below.

## Game play
The gameplay process is as follows:
1. Each level consists of 3 waves, where in each wave there will be a set of enemies coming to destroy the tower.
2. As our main aim is to protect the tower from getting destroyed, we have to kill the enemies. So, to kill the enemies we use the weapons which are shown in each level screenshot depicted above.
3. To use the weapons the player must buy them with the cash which they have. The process of buying a weapon is quite simple, player has to click on the weapon which he likes and click on any of the grass patch which he wants. The money is automatically deducted from the player’s when the weapon in placed
in that area.
4. Once a weapon is selected the player can place it any number of times in
different grass patches until they have enough to buy that weapon.
5. When the player does not have enough and tries to place the weapon on the
grass patches, then the grass patch is shown in the red color and doesn’t allow
them to place the weapon.
6. Once the weapon is placed and the enemies starts coming the weapons will
automatically shoot bullets towards the enemies when the enemies reaches the
weapon’s proximity.
7. As the player kills the enemies, the corresponding cash will be added to their account using which the player can add more weapons to the game.
8. If the player wants to sell a weapon which they have already placed in the game then the user can just click on the weapon and he gets a set of options which are upgrade and sell, using the sell option the player can sell the weapon and the amount is automatically credited into their account. If they want to upgrade, then they must choose the upgrade option and the weapon will be upgraded.
9. As we have a clear picture about how each level works let’s discuss about the menus. Let us start it with the main menu. As you see that there are 4 options for given to the player when the game opens which are as follows:
    - **Play** – Using this option the player can select the level and play the game.
    - **Continue Game** – If there is any unfinished level then continue game option will directly takes the player to that level.
    - **Options** – This consists of two options as you see below which are, mute which mutes and unmutes the sounds in the game when checked or unchecked and the second is to reset the levels which helps the player to start the game from the first level again.
    - **Quit** – Using this option the player can close the game.
10. The next screen after the hitting play is the select level screen which shows all the levels. In this screen the player can see all the levels but can select only the levels which they have unlocked.

## Game Elements
### Pause
This option helps the player to pause the game whenever the user wants. When the
game pauses a menu is showed to the user which has 3 options:
1. **Continue:** Continues the game from where it is paused.
2. **Start Over:** When the player clicks on this option, they can restart the level again.
3. **Main menu:** When the player clicks on this option the game redirect’s him to main menu.
As we got familiar with the options of the pause menu let’s see the pause option and its corresponding menu.

## Fast-Forward
This option helps the player to fasten the game.

## Guns
### Machine Gun
This is a basic gun which makes a minimal damage to the enemies. As we discussed before every weapon can be upgraded. So, the capacity of the gun increases a little bit.

### Missile Launcher
This weapon is a higher-grade weapon when compared to machine gun. This makes a midlevel damage just by shooting a missile to the enemies. As we discussed before every weapon can be upgraded.

### Lazar Shooter
This weapon is a higher-grade weapon when compared to machine gun. The Lazar
shooter shoots a lazar bean which will reduce the movement speed of the enemy. As we discussed before every weapon can be upgraded. 

### Enemy Goblin
This is the sole enemy used in all the levels with different sizes and different health depletion rates. The enemy gets bigger and stronger for each level.
